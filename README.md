# Cubelets
Sample Cubelets effect made for CubeCraft Games

This Cubelet is inspired by the existing "Uber", but with an angelic theme. The animation adds an Angel, changes in the surrounding blocks, particles and some sounds.

## How to use it?

*Note: Because it's a test plugin only made to show an animation, it would only be fully functional if the surrounding blocks are the 
same as the video attached in the mail (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYJ5j2KpZ7k), just as shown below:*
